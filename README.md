# Building Impact Model

Monte Carlo Analysis to simulate flood impacts to buildings. 


## Input Data

- floor_plans_raw.xlsx - spreadsheet containing details of each floorplan 

- component_lca_data.xlsx - spreadsheet containing RS Means cost and GHG emissions for multiple material options for each building component

## Scripts

- main.py - run this file

    - loads floor plans and lca data

    - calculates component quantities and fragility parameters

    - generate N flood simulations at each flood depth for each floor plan
    
    - calculate total replacement cost and GHG emissions from all components for each floor plan at all flood depths

    - save results to file


- calculations.py - functions for calculating quantities and generating simulations

- parse.py - function for converting the data for each floorplan into a table of components

    - the current solution is hacky and should be improved, but it works so it's low priority.

- utils.py - functions for loading in the cost and LCA data. 

    - future work should include linking cost and lca data by specific material choice


## results

Each row in the results file represents one simulation for a given floor plan at a given flood depth

The following columns are present in the results file generated by `main.py`:

- plan_id: unique identifier corresponding to the floor plan

- num_floors: number of floors in the structures

- floor_area: floor area listed on the floorplan in square feet

- n_ned: number of bedrooms in the structure

- n_bath: number of bathrooms in the structure

- n_car: size of the garage attached to the structure (number of parking spaces)

- rs_means_cost: total replacement cost of the structure (estimated from RS Means Square Foot Costs Data)

- flood_depth: depth of flooding relative to first floor elevation used in the given simulation

- sum_damage: total replacement cost resulting from damage to components from the given flood

- sum_co2: total greenhouse gas emissions resulting from damage to components from the given flood
