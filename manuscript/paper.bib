  abstract = {Light-frame wood building construction dominates the single-family residential home market in the United States. Such buildings are susceptible to damage from extreme winds due to hurricanes in coastal areas and tornados in the Midwest. The consequences of extreme winds on the built environment and on social and economic institutions within the community can be severe and are likely to increase in the coming decades as a result of increases in urbanization and economic development and the potential impacts of changing climate in hazard prone areas. Current building practices provide minimum standards for occupant safety and health, including structural integrity, water and sanitation, lighting, ventilation, means of egress and fire protection. However, they generally do not consider building resilience, which includes robustness and an ability to recover following extreme natural hazard events. Nor do they address sustainability, the notion that building design, construction and rehabilitation should not adversely impact the environment. In this paper, we establish a generalized cost and carbon footprint life-cycle analysis methodology for examining the benefits of different building practices for residential light-frame wood construction subjected to tornado hazards. A multiobjective approach is used to reveal tradeoffs between resilient and sustainable practices for typical residential construction. We show that when the life cycle of a typical residence is considered, a balance between resilience, sustainability and cost might be achieved in design and rehabilitation of residential building construction for tornado hazards.},

  abstract = {Tornadoes pose a significant threat to residential communities, causing enormous physical damage and losses to their social fabric. The dominant type of single-family residential buildings in the USA is light-frame wood construction, which is especially susceptible to tornado effects. Previous studies considering resilience of light-frame wood buildings have focused primarily on assessing damage, developing damage functions, and exploring different repair methods. Studies related to sustainability have focused mainly on environmental impacts or carbon usage. Practically all of these studies have been geared to assessment of individual buildings. In this study, we couple resilience and sustainability to evaluate their tradeoffs or alignments at the community level from a life-cycle stance. The life-cycle cost and carbon footprint are reflected in the construction and repair of damages due to the tornado hazard, as well as regular repair and maintenance that occurs during the life of the residence. Uncertainties in the randomness in tornado occurrence, size of the tornado footprint, and variation in wind speed intensities within the tornado footprint, and capacities of the building structure and envelope play a significant role in building performance and are considered. We explore a number of repair strategies that might be adopted at the community level in decision-making and policy formulation for homeowners, home builders and community planners. These strategies provide a framework for integrating minimum cost and carbon footprint objectives in risk-informed decision-making, a topic that appears to be lacking in the literature.},

  abstract = {The primary purpose of the project was to identify materials and methods that will make the envelope of a house flood damage resistant. Flood damage resistant materials and systems are intended to be used to repair houses subsequent to flooding. This project was also intended to develop methods of restoring the envelopes of houses that have been flooded but are repairable and may be subject to future flooding. Then if the house floods again, damage will not be as extensive as in previous flood events and restoration costs and efforts will be minimized. The purpose of the first pair of field tests was to establish a baseline for typical current residential construction practice. The first test modules used materials and systems that were commonly found in residential envelopes throughout the U.S. The purpose of the second pair of field tests was to begin evaluating potential residential envelope materials and systems that were projected to be more flood-damage resistant and restorable than the conventional materials and systems tested in the first pair of tests. The purpose of testing the third slab-on-grade module was to attempt to dry flood proof the module (no floodwater within the structure). If the module could be sealed well enough to prevent water from entering, then this would be an effective method of making the interior materials and systems flood damage resistant. The third crawl space module was tested in the same manner as the previous modules and provided an opportunity to do flood tests of additional residential materials and systems. Another purpose of the project was to develop the methodology to collect representative, measured, reproducible (i.e. scientific) data on how various residential materials and systems respond to flooding conditions so that future recommendations for repairing flood damaged houses could be based on scientific data. An additional benefit of collecting this data is that it will be used in the development of a standard test procedure which could lead to the certification of building materials and systems as flood damage resistant.},

  abstract = {Flood risk is increasing rapidly around the world owing to the influence of climate change on precipitation levels. The refurbishment process is a complicated method of building construction after flooding. This study assesses all building costs in parallel with environmental emissions after repairs in a flood zone, in non-flood situations and when a flood hits the building, to determine the feasibility of repairs. Five types of building materials including common brick, concrete block, steel wall panels, wood, and precast concrete framing were assessed with a full life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) assessment under non-flood, low-flood, and high-flood conditions. The result of greenhouse gas analysis showed that timber was the best choice for constructing the building, while, in case of flood occurrence, precast concrete framing shows better performance by releasing less CO2 after the repair stage. The result of cost analysis indicated that despite timber being an ideal material for use in building construction, it is the costliest option in a high-flood situation due to its high repair costs. The benchmark results show that timber and steel frame were the worst materials to use in a flood zone, while brick was the most sustainable one. The findings of this paper prove that wood as a building material in flood zones is not ideal and that alternative materials such as brick have better functionality in terms of both global warming mitigation and LCC. The findings of this study provide insight into enhancing coordination among government bodies in the provision of post-disaster permanent housing adapted to climate change. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the effect of wind hazards may be exacerbated due to increases in the typhoon intensity and frequency caused by the climate change effect. Therefore, developing a framework to evaluate and quantify the damage caused by wind hazards on tall buildings from the economic perspective is critical for engineers and building owners in designing a cost-effective tall building. In this study, an economic damage indicator, life-cycle cost, is measured by using a probabilistic method called life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA). Moreover, the building sector is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the environmental impact that may be generated in intervention activities after wind-induced damage occurs is analyzed. An environmental impact indicator, embodied carbon emission, is quantified by employing another probabilistic method called life-cycle assessment (LCA). Therefore, an integrated methodology combining the LCCA and LCA is proposed to evaluate potential damage costs and environmental impact caused by typhoon hazards on tall buildings.},

Life cycle analysis (LCA) procedures have thus been developed, in recent years, to assess the environmental impact of construction and operational phases through the entire building life cycle. Furthermore, the economic, environmental, and social consequences of recent natural disasters have encouraged the additional integration of hazard-induced impacts into common LCA procedures for buildings. Buildings are however expected to provide the population with safe living and working conditions, even when hit by different types of hazards during their service life, such as earthquakes. Hence, next-generation LCA procedures should include not only hazard-induced impacts, but also the contribution of potential retrofitting strategies that may alter the structural and energy performances of buildings throughout their remaining service life. This study presents a life cycle framework that accounts for the contributions of initial construction, operational energy consumption, earthquake-induced damage repair activities, potential retrofitting interventions, and demolition (considering also its associated potential material recycling), in terms of both monetary costs and environmental impacts. The proposed methodology can be used to undertake cost-benefit analyses aimed at identifying building renovation strategies that lead to an optimal balance, considering both economic and environmental impacts, between reduction of seismic vulnerability and increase of energy efficiency of a building, depending on the climatic conditions and the seismic hazard at the site of interest.},

Beginning with the 2016 release, land cover products were created for two-to-three-year intervals between 2001 and the most recent year. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation?s land cover and land cover change. NLCD continues to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database. The NLCD 2021 release is update based, so the Land Cover and Impervious Surface products{\dbend}released in{\dbend}2019 are unchanged and used directly with NLCD 2021 for change analysis though the NLCD timespan.{\dbend}Science products and the change index are updated and will need to be reacquired to contain the additional 2021 change. These new products use a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a theme-based post-classification protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and a scripted operational system. The overall accuracy of the 2019 Level I land cover was 91\%. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2021 operational mapping (see https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2023.2181143 for the latest accuracy assessment publication).

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been increasingly implemented in analyzing the environmental performance of buildings and construction projects. To assess the life cycle environmental performance, decision-makers may adopt the two life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) approaches, namely the midpoint and endpoint models. Any imprudent usage of the two approaches may affect the assessment results and thus lead to misleading findings. ReCiPe, a well-known work, includes a package of LCIA methods to provide assessments on both midpoint and endpoint levels. This study compares different potential LCIA results using the midpoint and endpoint approaches of ReCiPe based on the assessment of a commercial building in Hong Kong. This paper examines 23 materials accounting for over 99 \% of the environmental impacts of all the materials consumed in commercial buildings in Hong Kong. The midpoint and endpoint results are compared at the normalization level. A commercial building in Hong Kong is further studied to provide insights as a real case study. The ranking of impact categories and the contributions from various construction materials are examined for the commercial building. Influence due to the weighting factors is discussed. Normalization results of individual impact categories of the midpoint and endpoint approaches are consistent for the selected construction materials. The difference in the two approaches can be detected when several impact categories are considered. The ranking of materials is slightly different under the two approaches. The ranking of impact categories demonstrates completely different features. In the case study of a commercial building in Hong Kong, the contributions from subprocesses are different at the midpoint and endpoint. The weighting factors can determine not only the contributions of the damage categories to the total environment, but also the value of a single score. In this research, the midpoint and endpoint approaches are compared using ReCiPe. Information is whittled down from the inventories to a single score. Midpoint results are comprehensive while endpoint results are concise. The endpoint approach which provides additional information of damage should be used as a supplementary to the midpoint model. When endpoint results are asked for, a LCIA method like ReCiPe that provides both the midpoint and endpoint analysis is recommended. This study can assist LCA designers to interpret the midpoint and endpoint results, in particular, for the assessment of commercial buildings in Hong Kong.},

In this paper, probabilistic cost-benefit analysis of flood risk mitigation strategies for portfolios of residential buildings is performed in a life-cycle context. Additionally, an efficient methodology is proposed to aid decision makers on whether or not to retrofit portfolios of structures considering both expected and standard deviation of life-cycle cost. The vulnerability model of buildings under flood hazard is introduced considering serviceability and ultimate limit states. Probabilistic cost-benefit analysis is performed by comparing the effectiveness of different retrofit actions. Additionally, uncertainty and correlation effects are considered in the probabilistic loss and cost-benefit analysis procedures. The proposed approach is applied to a portfolio of residential buildings located in Florida to illustrate its capability and application. However, the proposed approach is general and can be applied to buildings located in other regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Additionally, temporary housing can also be used as a sustainable form of on-site residences for construction workers. While most of the building components used in temporary housing can be manufactured in a plant, prefabrication technology improves the production efficiency of temporary housing; furthermore, integrated renewable energy systems, for example, solar photovoltaic (PV) system, offer benefits for temporary housing operations. In order to assess the environmental impacts of prefabricated temporary housing equipped with renewable energy systems, this study first divides the life cycle of temporary housing into six stages, and then establishes a life cycle assessment (LCA) model for each stage. Furthermore, with the aim of reducing the environmental impacts, life cycle carbon reduction measures are proposed for each stage of temporary housing. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case study in China. Based on the proposed carbon reduction measures, the LCA of a prefabricated temporary housing case study building equipped with renewable energy systems indicates a carbon emissions intensity of 35.7 kg/m(2).per year, as well as a reduction in material embodied emissions of 18\%, assembly emissions of 17.5\%, and operational emissions of 91.5\%. This research proposes a carbon reduction-driven LCA of temporary housing and contributes to promoting sustainable development of prefabricated temporary housing equipped with renewable energy systems.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research project is to improve understanding of the climate change impact of flood and coastal erosion risk management (FCERM) policy in England. Establishing an accurate picture of how FCERM contributes to emissions of GHGs -- in effect its `carbon footprint' - is critical to facilitating effective policy responses for reducing future emissions. In addition, mitigating the drivers of climate change now can reduce the potential costs of adaptation in the future. The research aims of the project are to: * Provide an evidence base to support the current best estimate of the contribution of FCERM policy to GHG emissions; * Investigate and evaluate the impact of different FCERM policy options on GHG emissions; * Identify the FCERM policy areas most likely to present significant threats and opportunities for the release/abatement of GHG emissions and the extent of these impacts in terms of contributing to UK GHG reduction targets; and * Facilitate understanding of the consequences of current and potential Government intervention in FCERM policy on climate change. The approach to addressing the research aims is that of a desk-based assessment. No primary data collection has been undertaken; all evidence is collated from secondary sources. The main elements of the assessment are: (i) a conceptual review of the policy context for the project, which informs the scope and subsequent framework for the analysis; and (ii) collation and analysis of currently available data to estimate as best possible the carbon footprint of FCERM policy. With respect to (ii), the availability of data can represent a significant challenge to carbon footprinting exercises. This is often the case when a subject area is addressed for the first time as is the case for the entirety of FCERM policy},

  abstract = {Given their increasing trend in Europe, an understanding of the role that flooding events play in carbon and nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be important for improved assessments of local and 10 regional GHG budgets. This study presents the results of an analysis of the CO2 and N2O fluxes from a coastal grassland ecosystem affected by episodic flooding that was of either a relatively short or long duration (SFS and LFS sites, respectively). Compared to the SFS, the annual CO2 and N2O emissions were 1.4 and 1.3 times higher at the LFS, respectively. Mean CO2 emissions during the period of standing water were 144 {\textpm} 18.18 and 111 {\textpm} 9.51 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1, respectively, for the LFS and SFS sites. During the growing season, when there was no 15 standing water, the CO2 emissions were significantly larger from the LFS (244 {\textpm} 24.88 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1) than the SFS (183 {\textpm} 14.90 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1). Fluxes of N2O ranged from -0.37 to 0.65 mg N2O-N m-2 h-1 at the LFS and from -0.50 to 0.55 mg N2O-N m-2 h-1 at the SFS, with the larger emissions associated with the presence of standing water at the LFS and during the growing season at the SFS. Overall, soil temperature and moisture content were identified as the main drivers of the seasonal changes in CO2 fluxes, but neither adequately 20 explained the variations in N2O fluxes. Analysis of total Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N), microbial biomass and Q10 values, indicated that the higher CO2 emissions from the LFS were linked to the flooding-associated influx of nutrients and alterations in soil microbial populations. These results demonstrate that annual CO2 and N2O emissions can be higher in longer-term flooded sites that receive significant amounts of nutrients and where diffusional limitations due to the presence of standing water is limited to periods of the year when the 25 temperatures are lowest.},

Water heating system contribute to a building's energetic consumption, mainly in residential units, throughout the building's operational phase. Variability in energy sources, reservation and distribution systems of hot water along with the types of construction materials used in these building systems are key decisions to make in the initial design phases of a building project. Often, the definition of the most appropriate water heating system for a building is made via a technical-economic decision. However, the decision is rarely based on natural resource consumption and environmental impact generation throughout the life-cycle of the heating systems and of buildings as a whole. This study presents an application of a specific environmental management tool, based on an integrated Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA) method for selection of hot water systems, during the early design building phase. The proposed approach is implemented in the pre-operational phase, in order to enable decision makers to appreciate the resulting environmental performance of water heating systems in buildings. The applicability of the framework is tested via a comparative study of solar heating water systems and natural gas heating water systems for a residential multifamily building to be constructed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For the indicators damage to human health and damage to ecosystem, results indicate that the greatest impact on global warming comes from the natural gas heating system, while for solar heating, free particulate matter was the highest negative contribution. The operation phase for the natural gas system was highest for climate change while for solar heating system, it was the fresh water that was impacted the most during the pre-operational phase of the system's use.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a macroscale semi-distributed hydrologic model. VIC development began in the early 1990s and the model has since been used extensively for basin- to global-scale applications that include hydrologic dataset construction, trend analysis of hydrologic fluxes and states, data evaluation and assimilation, forecasting, coupled climate modeling, and climate change impact assessment. Ongoing operational applications of the VIC model include the University of Washington's drought monitoring and forecasting systems and NASA's Land Data Assimilation System. This paper documents the development of VIC version 5 (VIC-5), which includes a major reconfiguration of the legacy VIC source code to support a wider range of modern hydrologic modeling applications. The VIC source code has been moved to a public GitHub repository to encourage participation by the broader user and developer communities. The reconfiguration has separated the core physics of the model from the driver source code, whereby the latter is responsible for memory allocation, preprocessing and post-processing, and input--output (I--O). VIC-5 includes four drivers that use the same core physics modules, but which allow for different methods for accessing this core to enable different model applications. Finally, VIC-5 is distributed with robust test infrastructure, components of which routinely run during development using cloud-hosted continuous integration. The work described here provides an example to the model development community for extending the life of a legacy model that is being used extensively. The development and release of VIC-5 represents a significant step forward for the VIC user community in terms of support for existing and new model applications, reproducibility, and scientific robustness.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {Interest in sustainability and resilience of buildings has led to a growing body of literature on merging environmental impact assessment methods with seismic loss estimation methods. Researchers have taken different approaches to connecting the two fields with the common goal of estimating the social, environmental, and economic impacts of damage to buildings subject to seismic events and thus enabling the study of tradeoffs between performance objectives. The differences among these studies include topics such as treatment of uncertainty, types of components and systems considered in the performance assessment, fidelity of structural analysis ranging from region-specific empirical fragility curves to detailed building-specific finite element analysis, scope of life cycle assessment, and so on. One of the aspects of the most diverse treatment has been in obtaining environmental impact data and relating it to pre-use impact estimates. For example, the translation of damage and repairs into life-cycle environmental impacts has been done by one of three approaches: (1) Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) has been applied to economic loss estimates; (2) repair cost-ratios have been applied to environmental impacts from the pre-use stage; and (3) repair descriptions have been used to model environmental impacts of damage scenarios directly using process life cycle assessment (LCA). All of the approaches are generally accepted but may pose limitations in certain applications and can potentially result in inconsistent conclusions from study to study. A review of existing literature in the area is presented and is followed by a comparative analysis and discussion of the outcomes of taking different environmental life cycle assessment approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the research efforts in this area and discusses opportunities for further development in order to make the implementation consistent and practical for design decision making.},

The combination of increased urbanization and rising sea levels makes it a concern of increasing societal importance. This study offers a new perspective on environmental impact assessment of flood related repairs related to a single-family residence using life cycle assessment. A typical European house built in the 2010's is modelled in the life cycle assessment framework with focus on items damaged by a flood. Flood damage is assessed on the detail level of the house's different components using flood depth as the indicator of damage level. A life cycle inventory is built individually for each considered item group affected by flooding. The influence of flood depths and house ages are studied. The results show that the main impacts of flood related repairs come from the replacement of the wooden flooring, the water heater and furniture. Overall, flood related repairs add between 3.5 and 17.8\% of environmental impacts to the life cycle of the house depending on house age and flood depth; deeper water and bad timing in relation to maintenance cycles causing more impacts. Moreover, a very high positive correlation between environmental and economic impact is found in most impact categories. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Purpose Sustainability of a material-based product mainly depends on the materials used for the product itself or during its lifetime. A material selection decision should not only capture the functional performance required but should also consider the economical, social, and environmental impacts originated during the product life cycle. There is a need to assess social impacts of materials along the full life cycle, not only to be able to address the "social dimension" in sustainable material selection but also for potentially improving the circumstances of affected stakeholders. This paper presents the method and a case study of social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) specialized for comparative studies. Although the authors' focus is on material selection, the proposed methodology can be used for comparative assessment of products in general. Methods The method is based on UNEP/SETAC "guidelines for social life-cycle assessment of products" and includes four main phases: goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment, and life cycle interpretation. However, some special features are presented to adjust the framework for materials comparison purpose. In life cycle inventory analysis phase, a hot spot assessment is carried out using material flow analysis and stakeholder and experts' interviews. Based on the results of that, a pairwise comparison method is proposed for life cycle impact assessment applying analytic hierarchy process. A case study was conducted to perform a comparative assessment of the social and socioeconomic impacts in life cycle of concrete and steel as building materials in Iran. For hot spot analysis, generic and national level data were gathered, and for impact assessment phase, site-specific data were used. Result and discussion The unique feature of the proposed method compared with other works in S-LCA is its specialty to materials and products comparison. This leads to some differences in methodological issues of S-LCA that are explained in the paper in detail. The case study results assert that "steel/iron" in the north of Iran generally has the better social performance than "concrete/cement." However, steel is associated with many negative social effects in some subcategories, e. g., freedom of association, fair salary, and occupational health in extraction phase. Against, social profile of concrete and cement industry is damaged mainly due to the negative impact of cement production on safe and healthy living condition. The case study presented in this article shows that the evaluation of social impacts is possible, even if the assessment is always affected by subjective value systems. Conclusions Application of the UNEP/SETAC guidelines in comparative studies can be encouraged based on the results of this paper. It enables a hotspot assessment of the social and socio-economic impacts in life cycle of alternative materials. This research showed that the development of a specialized S-LCA approach for materials and products comparison is well underway although many challenges still persist. Particularly characterization method in life cycle impact assessment phase is challenging. The findings of this case study pointed out that social impacts are primarily connected to the conduct of companies and less with processes and materials in general. These findings confirm the results of Dreyer et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess 11(2): 88-97, 2006). The proposed approach aims not only to identify the best socially sustainable alternative but also to reveal product/process improvement potentials to facilitate companies to act socially compatible. It will be interesting to apply the UNEP/SETAC approach of S-LCA to other materials and products; materials with a more complex life cycle will be a special challenge. As with any new method, getting experience on data collection and evaluation, building a data base, integrating the method in software tools, and finding ways for effective communication of results are important steps until integrating S-LCA in routine decision support.},

  abstract = {Damage to residential buildings in the United States caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural hazards is significant. Economic losses average approximately \$5.4 billion annually from hurricanes and approximately \$4.4 billion a year from earthquakes. In certain areas, multiple hazards pose a significant threat to buildings, however, it is a challenge to optimize allocation of hazard mitigation resources. To cost-effectively mitigate risk from multiple natural hazards, a better understanding of building performance during extreme natural events will provide a basis for achieving cost-effective mitigation of risk from competing natural hazards. This paper demonstrates a risk-cost-benefit framework for assessing damage risks and cost-effectiveness of mitigation strategies for residential buildings using life-cycle and scenario-case analysis. The framework includes probabilistic modeling of the occurrence and intensity of natural hazards, structural system fragility modeling to represent the conditional probability of damage, and a model of total expected cost during different service intervals. The assessment can support improvements in design and construction practices, insurance underwriting, and planning community response to disasters. Many factors that are hard to quantify yet important in risk assessment are discussed for their roles and impacts on hazard mitigation decision making. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000204.

Life-cycle analysis (LCA) often incorporates building maintenance as part of use-phase environmental impacts; however, hazard-induced repairs are largely ignored. Furthermore, "sustainable" design strategies can lead to more damage and higher life-cycle impacts if the selected materials are less hazard resistant. This study presents an integrated sustainability and resilience assessment model for flood hazards for coastal, single-family residential (SFR) building designs that incorporates a probabilistic procedure for determining flood-related repairs during the useful life of the building and an LCA-based method for measuring the environmental impact of the building considering initial construction and flood-induced repairs. For a case study located in Saint Petersburg, Florida, the model shows that with minor changes in component configuration and materials, environmental sustainability indicators of embodied energy, carbon footprint, and water consumption can be reduced by approximately 40-60\% when considering coastal flood damage repairs over a 30 year building life. The case study demonstrates that the model is a useful framework to support effective decision making considering life-cycle environmental impacts within an integrated sustainability and resilience performance-based design construct for residential buildings subjected to flood hazards within coastal areas.

Oftentimes these damage estimates are used to determine the feasibility of flood protection or mitigation projects or to plan for future disasters. While existing standardised functions are used to estimate potential economic loss for residential buildings, functions can be customised to assess the environmental impacts of flood damages for specific building designs. This study presents a methodology for customising functions to estimate the carbon footprint of flood-related building repairs. Unlike regular home repairs, which are based on material life expectancy, flood repairs are dependent on the severity of the flood hazard (i.e., flood depth) and probability of hazard occurrence within the lifespan of a building. To demonstrate the methodology, customised functions are developed for a case study home design in Saint Petersburg, Florida.},

Environmental performance of the retrofit and new build was measured using life-cycle assessments, examining the assembly, operational and end-of-life stage over life spans of 50 and 80 years. Using primary information, life-cycle assessment software and life-cycle assessment databases the environmental impacts of each stage were modelled. The operational stage of both case studies was found to be the source of the most significant environmental damage, followed by the assembly and the end-of-life stage respectively. The relative importance of the assembly and end-of-life stage decreased as the life span increased. It was found that the retrofit house studied outperformed the new build in the assembly and operational stage, whereas the new build performed better in the end-of-life stage; however, this is highly sensitive, depending on the standards to which both are completed. Operational energy savings pre- and post-retrofit were significant, indicating the future potential for adoption of high-quality retrofitting practices.},

To solve this problem, adaptation of buildings to control of thermal comfort and its impact on their energy consumption is a solution considered. In building envelope, technical improvement of the window goes in this direction. From simple glazing, practically no more used in Europe, to double glazing, four times more thermally efficient than the previous one, triple glazing is used now, the most insulating of the three. Because the magnitude of climate change depends mainly on greenhouse gas emissions, a comparative Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) between a uPVC double and triple glazed window is carried out in this study. But rather than using a conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), we use a Dynamic LCA (Dy-LCA) because giving more realistic results by introducing the temporal dimension. Indeed, the contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is determined by the characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime. To take into account temporal dimension, ESPA (Enhanced Structural Path Analysis) method, coupled with Open LCA software, is used in this research work. So, a Dynamic Life Cycle Inventory (Dy-LCI) is determined and analyzed for these two products.},

Consequently, vulnerability and risk will vary geographically, creating the imperative need for local and regional governments to have systems in place that provide information necessary for climate adaptation focused on vulnerable populations. In this study, 100-year recurrence interval flood extents and depths were estimated using an ensemble of 6 independent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models for a past and future period under the highest emissions climate scenario. The flood inundation results were related to social vulnerability for two select study areas on the Mississippi River Basin. The minimum, average and maximum flood extents and depths for both time periods was estimated, and the difference in results was evaluated to determine the effects of climate change on flooding. The relationship between the spatial distribution of flood depths and vulnerability was then assessed to identify at-risk areas. Finally, an analysis of the current and future damages on infrastructure from flooding on residential housing was performed to determine if damages are correlated with areas of higher vulnerability. Results found that in every flooding scenario, flood extents and depths are increasing in the future compared to the past, ranging from a 6-76 square km increase in extent across both locations. A statistically significant relationship between spatial clusters of flooding and of vulnerability was found. The infrastructure analysis found that residential structures in the most vulnerable census tracts are 6 to 59 times more likely to experience moderate damage compared to the least vulnerable tracts depending on the time period, domain and statistical scenario. Overall, we have established a framework to holistically understand the hydrologic and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and a methodology to utilize when allocating resources at the local scale.}

  abstract = {Although flood risk assessments are frequently associated with significant uncertainty, formal uncertainty analyses are the exception rather than the rule. We propose to separate two fundamentally different types of uncertainty in flood risk analyses: aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty refers to quantities that are inherently variable in time, space or populations of individuals or objects. Epistemic uncertainty results from incomplete knowledge and is related to our inability to understand, measure and describe the system under investigation. The separation between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty is exemplified for the flood risk analysis of the city of Cologne, Germany. This flood risk assessment consists of three modules: (1) flood frequency analysis, (2) inundation estimation and (3) damage estimation. By the concept of parallel models, the epistemic uncertainty of each module is quantified. The epistemic uncertainty associated with the risk estimate is reduced by introducing additional information into the risk analysis. Finally, the contribution of different modules to the total uncertainty is quantified. The flood risk analysis results in a flood risk curve, representing aleatory uncertainty, and in associated uncertainty bounds, representing epistemic uncertainty. In this way, the separation reveals the uncertainty (epistemic) that can be reduced by more knowledge and the uncertainty (aleatory) that is not reducible.},

  abstract = {The construction sector across the world involves constructing huge buildings, which usually consumes enormous energy, causing an incredibly damaging effect on the environment in terms of raw material usage, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted, and waste generated in huge quantities, which has drawn much attention from conservationists. Though several preventive measures have been developed to reduce the impact of construction, they are often ignored or mismanaged. Thus, things must be examined in detail with appropriate environmental tools to provide a clear view of the emission released into the environment and mitigate the problem from a broader perspective. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one tool used for quantifying the emissions into the environment and economic impacts of the chosen product/process. As a result, this study investigates the effects of the precast structural elements for building and their carbon footprint at the different construction phases based on the LCA methodology. The construction phases include (a) the preoperational phase/building construction, (b) the operation phase, and (c) the postoperational phase/building demolition and inventory data are collected from the selected building. The results show that the precast structure's energy (23.33 kW . h/m(2)) was less compared with reviewed case studies. The global warming potential (GWP) of the present study, 16.55 kg CO2 eq/m(2), was the least among all the studies. The life cycle cost (LCC) analysis of buildings was performed, and the LCC of precast structures was 4.78\% less than the conventional construction. The study evaluates and compares each phase's emissions and identifies specific hotspots for emissions into the environment. Finally, the authors believe that the study provides valuable insights into the potential environmental impacts for the relevant stakeholders and experts.

  abstract = {Numerous strategies have been implemented to reduce the global environmental burden of construction activities in order to achieve sustainable development goals. However, with regard to renovating and retrofitting existing buildings, life cycle assessment (LCA)-based studies mostly focus on the improvement of a building's energy performance rather than on the structural aspects of the retrofit itself. The present study assesses the life cycle environmental impacts of different replacement options for a typical old flat roof belonging to a masonry building. Three different structural options are considered: reinforced concrete joists and hollow clay blocks, steel joists and concrete slab, and reinforced concrete joists and polystyrene panels. The environmental analysis is based on a new approach wherein the structural and functional properties of a new flat roof are set as fixed requirements for the design of the different replacement options. A cradle-to-grave LCA-based study is then conducted for the environmental assessment of the entire retrofit process, including different waste scenarios. SimaPro software and IMPACT2002+ methodology are used for the LCA analysis, enabling quantification of the environmental impacts of the three flat roofing options by means of 4 endpoint and 15 midpoint indicators. The environmental contribution of each life cycle phase related to the replacement of the old flat roof is assessed. The results demonstrate that within the life cycle of each option, the use phase and the construction phase have the highest environmental impact, ranging from 60 to 70 \% and 50 to 80 \% of the total burden in the Climate Change/Resources and Human Health/Ecosystem Quality damage categories, respectively. Having initially set structural and functional constraints for the analysis, the results show that any of the different options exhibits an overall lowest environmental performance. Consequently, specific environmental burdens/categories can be identified to optimize the sustainable retrofit design. The work demonstrates that a comprehensive LCA-based approach can be used to effectively drive the design of structural and functional retrofit operations on existing buildings. This study also shows how a rigorous environmental analysis, conducted by implementing the proposed approach, can influence decision-making for the most sustainable design alternatives.},

While such approaches have been used extensively by communities, they do not enable the propagation of uncertainty into a risk- or resilience-informed decision process. In this paper, a method that allows the development of building fragility and building loss functions is articulated and applied to develop an archetype portfolio that can be used to model buildings in a typical community. The typical single-variable flood vulnerability function, normally based on flood depth, is extended to a multi-variate flood vulnerability function, which is a function of both flood depth and flood duration, thereby creating fragility surfaces. The portfolio presented herein consists of 15 building archetypes that can serve to populate a community-level model to predict damage and resulting functionality from a scenario flood event. The prediction of damage and functionality of buildings within a community is the first step in developing risk-informed mitigation decisions to improve community resilience.},

Flood-related data scarcity and the use of deterministic models present challenges when seeking to include uncertainties in flood damage modeling. In this paper, a single-variable and multi-variate component-based flood fragility method is proposed. The method uses expert-based data derived from online sources that are applied within a Monte Carlo framework to divide the building into independent components and then assigns these components to five predefined damage states that describe the building damage as a whole. Using a series of Monte Carlo simulations, uncertainties in flood depth and flood duration that result in each damage level for each component were propagated. Their damage is then characterized using component fragility functions to be used to develop total building fragility and loss functions. The resulting fragilities can be used as a probabilistic vulnerability function to be assigned to a real community based on building archetype and occupancy. The ability to develop flood fragility curves for buildings without the need for empirical field data is the primary contribution of this work.},

  abstract = {Intensively managed grasslands are large sources of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and important regulators of methane (CH4) consumption and production. The predicted increase in flooding frequency and severity due to climate change could increase N2O emissions and shift grasslands from a net CH4 sink to a source. Therefore, effective management strategies are critical for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from flood-prone grasslands. We tested how repeated flooding affected the N2O and CH4 emissions from 11 different plant communities (Festuca arundinacea, Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis, and Trifolium repens in monoculture, 2- and 4-species mixtures), using intact soil cores from an 18-month old grassland field experiment in a 4-month greenhouse experiment. To elucidate potential underlying mechanisms, we related plant functional traits to cumulative N2O and CH4 emissions. We hypothesized that traits related with fast nitrogen uptake and growth would lower N2O and CH4 emissions in ambient (non-flooded) conditions, and that traits related to tissue toughness would lower N2O and CH4 emissions in flooded conditions. We found that flooding increased cumulative N2O emissions by 97 fold and cumulative CH4 emissions by 1.6 fold on average. Plant community composition mediated the flood-induced increase in N2O emissions. In flooded conditions, increasing abundance of the grass F. arundinacea was related with lower N2O emissions; whereas increases in abundance of the legume T. repens resulted in higher N2O emissions. In non-flooded conditions, N2O emissions were not clearly mediated by plant traits related with nitrogen uptake or biomass production. In flooded conditions, plant communities with high root carbon to nitrogen ratio were related with lower cumulative N2O emissions, and a lower global warming potential (CO2 equivalent of N2O and CH4). We conclude that plant functional traits related to slower decomposition and nitrogen mineralization could play a significant role in mitigating N2O emissions in flooded grasslands.},

Resource-efficiency and circular-economy strategies, both industry and demand-focused, promise emission reductions through reducing material use, but detailed assessments of their GHG reduction potential are lacking. We present a global-scale analysis of material efficiency for passenger vehicles and residential buildings. We estimate future changes in material flows and energy use due to increased yields, light design, material substitution, extended service life, and increased service efficiency, reuse, and recycling. Together, these strategies can reduce cumulative global GHG emissions until 2050 by 20--52 Gt CO2-eq (residential buildings) and 13--26 Gt CO2e-eq (passenger vehicles), depending on policy assumptions. Next to energy efficiency and low-carbon energy supply, material efficiency is the third pillar of deep decarbonization for these sectors. For residential buildings, wood construction and reduced floorspace show the highest potential. For passenger vehicles, it is ride sharing and car sharing.},

The construction of stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) entails a series of life cycle environmental impacts but also implies avoided burdens, such as replacing urban infrastructure after flooding. The aim of this paper is to integrate flood damage prevention into the life cycle assessment (LCA) of BMPs for quantifying their net environmental impact (NEI) and environmental payback (EP) from a consequential LCA standpoint. As a case study, the application of a filter, swale and infiltration trench (FST) in a Brazilian neighborhood was assessed considering a high-intensity rainfall event. The potential avoided impacts were related to cars and sidewalks that were not destroyed due to flooding. In terms of CO2eq. emissions, the environmental investment related to the FST was recovered when the destruction of one car or 84 m{$^2$} of sidewalk was prevented. The NEI of the FSTs resulted in significant impact reductions (up to 700\%) with respect to not accounting for the avoided products. This approach can be implemented to any type of BMP, and more accurate estimations can be made with data for different events and different types of material damage.},

  abstract = {Flood damage results in economic and environmental losses in the society, but flood prevention also entails an initial investment in infrastructure. This study presents an integrated eco-efficiency approach for assessing flood prevention and avoided damage. We focused on ephemeral streams in the Maresme region (Catalonia, Spain), which is an urbanized area affected by damaging torrential events. Our goal was to determine the feasibility of post-disaster emergency actions implemented after a major event through an integrated hydrologic, environmental and economic approach. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and costing (LCC) were used to determine the eco-efficiency of these actions, and their net impact and payback were calculated by integrating avoided flood damage. Results showed that the actions effectively reduced damage generation when compared to the registered water flows and rainfall intensities. The eco-efficiency of the emergency actions resulted in 1.2kgCO2eq. per invested euro. When integrating the avoided damage into the initial investment, negative net impacts were obtained (e.g., -5.2E+05{\texteuro} and -2.9E+04kgCO2eq. per event), which suggests that these interventions contributed with environmental and economic benefits to the society. The economic investment was recovered in two years, whereas the design could be improved to reduce their environmental footprint, which is recovered in 25years. Our method and results highlight the effects of integrating the environmental and economic consequences of decisions at an urban scale and might help the administration and insurance companies in the design of prevention plans and climate change adaptation.},

Primary data supplied by a Portuguese manufacturer contributed for achieving ac\- curate life cycle inventory data that were then modelled in SimaPro 8.5.0 complemented with data from Ecoinvent database 3.4. The assessment was performed using the Recipe 2016 Midpoint V1.01 at the Hierarchist perspective. The results of the study show that the use stage (mainly owing to water consumption and fuel precombustion and combustion) is by far the largest contributor to the environmental burdens, followed by the raw materials production stage. The comparison between the two fuels considered demonstrates that liquefied pe\- troleum gas leads to higher impacts than natural gas, mainly as a result of emissions from its own life cycle. The environmental damage varies noticeably in some impact categories depending on the country where this water heater is used, due to different natural gas origins. Practical implications of this work will enable the manu\- facturer to identify where to focus on the new water heaters that will be developed to achieve better levels of environment-friendliness.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We present an intercomparison of a suite of high-resolution downscaled climate projections based on a six-member General Circulation Model (GCM) ensemble from Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The CMIP6 GCMs have been downscaled using dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques based on two meteorological reference observations over the conterminous United States. We use the regional climate model, RegCM4, for dynamical downscaling, double bias correction constructed analogs method for statistical downscaling, and Daymet and Livneh datasets as the reference observations for statistical training and bias-correction. We evaluate the performances of downscaled data in both historical and future periods under the SSP585 scenario. While dynamical downscaling improves the simulation of some performance evaluation indices, it adds an extra bias in others, highlighting the need for statistical correction before its use in impact assessments. Downscaled datasets after bias-correction compare exceptionally well with observations. However, the choice of downscaling techniques and the underlying reference observations influence the hydroclimate characteristics of downscaled data. For instance, the statistical downscaling generally preserves the GCMs climate change signal but overestimates the frequency of hot extremes. Similarly, simulated future changes are sensitive to the choice of reference observations, particularly for precipitation extremes that exhibit a higher projected increase in the ensembles trained and/or corrected by Daymet than Livneh. Overall, these results demonstrate that multiple factors, including downscaling techniques and reference observations, can substantially influence the outcome of downscaled climate projections and stress the need for a comprehensive understanding of such method-based uncertainties.           ,              Key Points                                                                Choice of observation used in the bias-correction of downscaled historical climate data can result in marked differences in the outcome                                                     Differences in future projections arising from the choice of downscaling techniques are more prominent than those from the observations                                                     A more comprehensive framework is needed to capture the full range of methodological uncertainties in climate data downscaling},

These inventories were grouped into impact categories and scaled based on IMPACT 2002+ version 2.1 characterization and damage factors. The damage modeling indicated that the life cycle impacts are dominated by the combustion of non-renewable energy resources. The PVC life cycle used the most non-renewable energy and caused the most damage owing to that window's shorter service life. The disposal of aluminum cladding in the municipal waste stream caused greater aquatic ecotoxicity for the wood window. The sensitivity analysis revealed that replacing the virgin material in aluminum cladding with recycled content improved the life cycle impacts of the wood window. Using fiberglass or PVC to clad the wood window also improved the environmental performance. Other potential improvements to the life cycle impacts of the three windows include improving energy efficiency, particularly during the secondary manufacturing.},

A literature review shows that the related methods for environmental and economic performance, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC), show great potential for answering a multitude of questions related to building performance. Prevalent topics are the implications of LCA and LCC for retrofit solutions and the trade-offs between environmental and economic considerations in building design. A detailed review of 30 case studies shows the range of differing result integration methods and sheds light on the use of monetary valuation of environmental indicators for an integrated assessment. While a quasi-dynamic approach, accounting for the changing value of money over time, is common in LCC, such an approach is largely absent from LCA. The analysis of common metrics shows that the studies employ strongly differing system boundaries and input parameters. Moreover, a clear description of the methodological framework is missing in most studies. Therefore, this research develops an "Eco(2)" framework, integrating LCA and LCC for application in building design. Potential further developments for Eco(2) building assessment are related to extending the system boundaries by including mechanical systems and end-of-life phases, data collection and structuring, and streamlining the approach for continuous application to all stages of building design processes. Additionally, the influence on design decisions of employing temporal parameters in both LCA and LCC and of choosing particular result integration methods should be investigated further.},

Yet, equity remains largely outside of standard water resources planning and management practices. Inclusion of equity within water resources infrastructure is inhibited by barriers including an incomplete conceptual understanding of equity, a perceived lack of quantitative and qualitative equity metrics, unclear connections between equity and standard project planning frameworks, and the absence of concrete examples. To facilitate greater practical inclusion of social equity in water resources practices, we describe equity relative to dimensions of distribution, procedure, and recognition and identify metrics associated with each. We then map these dimensions of equity onto different stages of a water resources project life cycle. We discuss how inequities are often perpetuated by current approaches and highlight case studies that promote one or more of the facets of equity. Rather than providing a prescriptive solution to ``achieve'' equity within water resources practices, we emphasize the need for contextualized approaches that include pragmatic steps toward more equitable practices and outcomes.},

The chosen method for impact assessment was EPD (2018) available in the SimaPro PhD software. The results showed that recycling has a positive effect on the environmental impacts, with the variation ranging from 0.3\% on Abiotic Depletion (FF) to 15.9\% on Eutrophication.

In order to enable a more comprehensive assessment of a building's environmental impact by accounting for seismic events, this project developed an environmental impact database of building component seismic damage - the largest of its kind known to date - by combining data from Carnegie Mellon University's Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) database with cost estimates of repair previously developed for FEMA's Performance Assessment Calculation Tool (PACT), a software that models probabilistic seismic damage in buildings. Fifteen indicators of environmental impacts were calculated for the repair of approximately 800 building components for up to five levels of seismic damage, capturing 'embodied' impacts related to cradle-to-gate manufacturing of building materials, products, and equipment. Analysis of the data revealed that non-structural and architectural finishes often dominated the environmental impacts of seismic damage per dollar spent in repair. A statistical analysis was performed on the data using Principal Component Analysis, confirming that embodied carbon, a popular metric for evaluating environmental impacts in building LCAs, is a suitable proxy for other relevant environmental impact metrics when assessing the impact of repairing earthquake damage of buildings.

We report a mean increase in the 100-year precipitation event of 20\% (magnitude) and {$>$}200\% (frequency) in a high warming scenario, yielding a 30--127\% increase in population exposure. We further find a nonlinear increase for the most intense precipitation events---suggesting accelerating societal impacts from historically rare or unprecedented precipitation events in the 21st century.},

The Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (               RAPID               ) was applied to the               MRB               with more than 1.2~million river reaches for a 10-year study (2005-2014). Runoff data from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (               VIC               ) model was used as input to               RAPID               . This article investigates the effect of topography on               RAPID               performance, the differences between the               VIC               -               RAPID               streamflow simulations in the               HUC               -2 regions of the               MRB               , and the impact of major dams on the streamflow simulations. The model performance improved when initial parameter values, especially the Muskingum K parameter, were estimated by taking topography into account. The statistical summary indicates the               RAPID               model performs better in the Ohio and Tennessee Regions and the Upper and Lower Mississippi River Regions in comparison to the western part of the               MRB               , due to the better performance of the               VIC               model. The model accuracy also increases when lakes and reservoirs are considered in the modeling framework. In general, results show the               VIC               -               RAPID               streamflow simulation is satisfactory at the continental scale of the               MRB               .},

  abstract = {In recent years, the United States and other countries have experienced catastrophic consequences of severe natural hazards, e.g. the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake, and the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. These consequences motivate the question: How should a community's damaged building portfolio be reconstructed efficiently to enhance its performance under future hazard events and meet the resilience goals of the community? The relatively recent notion of Building Back Better requires a quantitative methodology that can address each phase of building portfolio recovery following a severe hazard event and provide decision support to best enhance the performance of the portfolio under future hazards. This study extends notions of life-cycle analysis from individual buildings to building portfolios to support posthazard reconstruction decisions at the community level. The building portfolio expected life-cycle cost and cumulative prospect value are adopted as decision metrics which reflect varying degrees of risk aversion on the part of community decision-makers. The applicability of these building portfolio life-cycle analyses and some key aspects in their implementation are explored using a moderate-sized community that is susceptible to extreme earthquake hazards.},

It is particularly important to understand the characteristics of the building life cycle to reduce its environmental impact. This paper aims to assess the environmental impact of prefabricated buildings and traditional cast-in-situ buildings over the building life cycle using a hybrid model. A case study of a building with a 40\% assembly rate in Japan was employed for evaluation. It concluded that the total energy consumption, and carbon emissions of the prefabricated building was 7.54\%, and 7.17\%, respectively, less than that of the traditional cast-in-situ building throughout the whole life cycle. The carbon emissions reduction in the operation phase reached a peak of 4.05 kg CO2/year.m(2). The prefabricated building was found to cost less than the traditional cast-in-situ building, reducing the price per square meter by 10.62\%. The prefabricated building has advantages in terms of reducing global warming, acid rain, and health damage by 15\% reduction. With the addition of the assembly rate, the carbon emissions and cost dropped, bottoming out when the assembly rate was 60\%. After that, an upward trend was shown with the assembly rate increasing. Additionally, this study outlined that the prefabricated pile foundations is not applicable due to its high construction cost and environmental impact.},

This paper presents an innovative building life-cycle assessment framework quantifying environmental metrics and economic indicators of building performance, while accounting for potential risk of hazard events. The framework outlines interactions between building design and modeling, structural and environmental analysis, and life-cycle analysis. A lifecycle assessment of a commercial building in California, designed with and without a green roof, illustrates this methodology. Nonlinear analysis under earthquake ground motions assesses the seismic vulnerability of the structures through probabilistic loss estimation of required repairs. Environmental analysis quantifies building impacts in terms of fossil fuel consumption and climate change potential. The case study findings offer insight into the effects of seismic hazard performance on building environmental impact.},

Incorporating recent developments in inundation modelling, here we show a 26.4\% (24.1--29.1\%) increase in US flood risk by 2050 due to climate change alone under RCP4.5. Our national depiction of comprehensive and high-resolution flood risk estimates in the United States indicates current average annual losses of US\$32.1 billion (US\$30.5--33.8 billion) in 2020's climate, which are borne disproportionately by poorer communities with a proportionally larger White population. The future increase in risk will disproportionately impact Black communities, while remaining concentrated on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Furthermore, projected population change (SSP2) could cause flood risk increases that outweigh the impact of climate change fourfold. These results make clear the need for adaptation to flood and emergent climate risks in the United States, with mitigation required to prevent the acceleration of these risks.},

To improve the sustainability of the renovation practice of existing concrete structures, a supporting analysis of the life cycle environmental and financial consequences has a high added value with regards to the selection of durable service life-extending repair strategy. As corrosion is the main contributor to the degradation of existing concrete structures, a residential building in a Belgian coastal environment with damaged reinforced concrete balconies is selected as case study in order to evaluate five different frequently used repair techniques by means of a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCC): (i) patch repair, (ii) conventional repair, (iii) galvanic cathodic protection, (iv) impressed current cathodic protection and (v) total replacement of the element. For a short service lifetime extension (5y) of the balconies, a patch repair was revealed as the most preferable option as the existing situation is restored with a minimum of intervention. When a service life extension up to 40 years is requested, different options (conventional repair, cathodic protection) are found as competing performance options for both LCA and LCC. The total renewal of the balconies after demolition involves overall the highest LCA and LCC impact.},

Future impacts will be dependent on the level and rate of socioeconomic development, along with material use and supply strategies. Here we evaluate material-related greenhouse gas (GHG)~emissions for residential and commercial buildings along with their reduction potentials in 26 global regions by 2060. For a middle-of-the-road baseline scenario, building material-related emissions see an increase of 3.5 to 4.6 Gt CO2eq yr-1 between 2020--2060. Low- and lower-middle-income regions see rapid emission increase from 750 Mt (22\% globally) in 2020 and 2.4 Gt (51\%) in 2060, while higher-income regions shrink in both absolute and relative terms. Implementing several material efficiency strategies together in a High Efficiency (HE) scenario could almost half the baseline emissions. Yet, even in this scenario, the building material sector would require double its current proportional share of emissions to meet a 1.5\,{$^\circ$}C-compatible target.},
